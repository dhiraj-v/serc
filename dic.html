<b>VelGmat: Low Cost Gait Mat for Stance Phase
Calculation - [Mohammad Waqas Wani]</b><button class="button3"><b>ONGOING</b></button> <button class="button" onclick="window.open('https://youtube.com/shorts/B1z2VFsAtpo?feature=share', '_blank');"><b>DEMO</b></button><br>
Material science enables us to develop a wide array of materials capable enough to address worldly problems. Velostat is a carbon-impregnated polythene material used to address many problems including gait-related problems. We developed a novel approach to analyze a gait-cycle parameter called Stance-phase. We ideated, designed, and implemented a low-cost customizable Velostat sensing mat to calculate the stance phase. We validated our customized mat using sensor density, sensitivity, process time, and hardware performance metrics. Our validation results helped us improve the effectiveness of gait analysis. We conducted a comparative study between our low-cost customized mat and commercially available mat to understand the contrast in stance phase values. We observed 95% accuracy in stance phase values compared with commercially available mat. Considering these findings, our low-cost mat can be further customized for various applications in healthcare, gaming, and entertainment.

<b> CHORD Customizable Head Mount Device for Human Eye Disorder Detection using Virtual Reality - [Pawan Kumar Y] </b><button class="button3"><b>ONGOING</b></button> <button class="button" onclick="window.open('https://youtu.be/DvhQ_zAYENU ', '_blank');"><b>DEMO</b></button><br>
 Eye disorders like Myopia, Hypermetropia, and Color blindness affect millions of people around the world. Early detection can help the affected persons take preventive measures against further degradation. However, early detection requires regular testing and visits to trained healthcare professionals to judge the level of disorder. Customizing the test requirements for various disorders can simplify the diagnosis. As part of this paper, we present an approach towards developing a Virtual Reality (VR) based low-cost head-mounted device (HMD). The HMD can detect human eye disorders and other eye issues through VR applications, limiting healthcare professionals’ involvement. We created VR based scenes to examine Visual acuity test, Astigmatism, Color vision deficiency (CVD) and Age-related macular degeneration (AMD). We conducted a user study for visual acuity(myopia), CVD, astigmatism and AMD using CHORD, and the results were promising. We further discuss our plans to deploy such devices to detect eye disorders in economically vulnerable communities with limited access to healthcare professionals.

<b>Designing Limitless Paths in Virtual Reality Environments - [Raghav Mittal] </b> <button class="button3"><b>ONGOING</b></button> <button class="button" onclick="window.open('https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmBYfRN74mk ', '_blank');"><b>DEMO</b></button>
<br>Walking in a Virtual Environment is a bounded task. It is challenging for a subject to navigate a large virtual environment designed in a limited physical space. External hardware support may be required to achieve such an act in a concise physical area without compromising navigation and virtual scene rendering quality. This paper proposes an algorithmic approach to let a subject navigate a limitless virtual environment within a limited physical space with no additional external hardware support apart from the the regular Head-Mounted-Device (HMD) itself. As part of our work, we developed a Virtual Art Gallery as a use-case to validate our algorithm. We conducted a simple user-study to gather feedback from the participants to evaluate the ease of locomotion of the application. The results showed that our algorithm could generate limitless paths of our use-case under predefined conditions and can be extended to other use-cases.

VR is used for Visual acuity testing of myopia and astigmatic eyes and can be used in providing a piece of tentative information about the refractive errors in the human eye using HMD devices. 
<br>
This project was partially funded by Google (GCP credits). The goals of the project is to provide a visual acuity testing solution:
<ol>
<li>To the underprivileged and post covid-19 pandemic to serve as a remote, user-friendly, safe testing kit for personal usage where the patients are not required to flock hospitals for minor testing and diagnosis purposes for refractive errors in eye.</li>
<li>Also, this project may be expanded in future in areas like color-blindness and other eye-related ailments.</li>
<li>This project has been developed specifically using Unity in order to make it compatible with various VR specific platforms.</li>
 <li>In this project we aimed to digitize and automate the various eye-testing methods like Snellen Test (for myopia detection), Fan Test (for astigmatism detection) and with sufficient user data predict to the closest value possible what could be the refractive indexes of patients using the system.</li>

<b>Analysis of FinTech Mobile App Usability for Geriatric Users in India - [Sai Anirudh Karre]</b><button class="button4"><b>COMPLETED</b></button> <button class="paper" onclick="window.open('https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3205946.3205947', '_blank');"><b>PAPER</b></button> <br>  The usability of these FinTech applications across different age groups is still unclear. As part of the research, we explore the usability of FinTech mobile apps across different age groups through a quantitative survey and a more focused study on factors impacting the geriatric population on adopting FinTech mobile apps in India. The authors have interviewed geriatric users to identify their FinTech mobile usage. Based on the interviews, we built a heuristic usability experiment to capture real-time hurdles while participating in a real financial transaction. This study led us to build a model FinTech mobile app by incorporating derived usability guidelines. We evaluated the model app using an automated usability framework called UMETRIX.

<b>Gamily - Gamification Platform For All - [Shivam Khandelwal & Sai Krishna Sripada]</b>  <button class="button4"><b>COMPLETED</b></button> <button class="sourcecode" onclick="window.open('https://github.com/anhsirksai/GamifiedSD', '_blank');"><b>SOURCECODE</b></button>
<button class="thesis" onclick="window.open('https://web2py.iiit.ac.in/research_centres/publications/view_publication/mastersthesis/449', '_blank');"><b>THESIS</b></button> <br> Software engineering activities like code reviews, change management, knowledge management, issue tracking, etc. tend to be heavily process oriented. Gamification of such activities by composing the core activities
with game design elements like badges and points can increase developers' interest in performing such activities. While there are various frameworks/applications that assist in gamification, extending the frameworks to add any/all desired game de sign elements have not been adequately addressed. As part of our research, we designed and developed an extensible architectural framework for gamification of software engineering activities where in the game design elements are modeled as services. We create an example instance of our framework by building a prototype for code review activity and note the challenges of
designing such an extensible architectural framework. The example instance uses python's Flask micro framework and has five game design elements implemented as services, and exposed using restful APIs.
